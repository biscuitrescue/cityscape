# 🌐 CityScape

City Pulse is an intelligent, agent-driven platform that analyzes and predicts events in a city by processing multi-source data streams. Designed with Google Cloud technologies and agentic AI, it delivers real-time insights, proactive alerts, and user-specific summaries through an interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Data Ingestion & Processing**

* Pulls data from social APIs (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit) using Pub/Sub.
* Supports geo-tagged user uploads and web scraping.
* Normalizes and synthesizes data with Vertex AI.

✅ **Predictive Analytics**

* Detects city-wide trends and mood shifts.
* Predicts cascading effects using Vertex AI models.
* Provides actionable predictions for 3rd order effects (e.g., traffic surges, event escalations).

✅ **Reasoning & Actions**

* Deduplicates and classifies multi-source data.
* Generates summaries and plots incidents on live maps.
* Drives decisions using Vertex Agent Builder (Google ADK).

✅ **Interactive Dashboard**

* Built with Next.js for real-time updates.
* Displays mood overlays and geo-tagged reports.
* Supports offline summaries via Gemini API.

✅ **Proactive Notifications**

* Sends predictive alerts and user-specific summaries.
* Filters notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
